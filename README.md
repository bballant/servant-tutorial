# servant-tutorial

A servant based service stack built up from scratch, based (w/ much copy-pasta!) on https://github.com/parsonsmatt/servant-persistent

The goal is to have a db-backed service to replace Yesod with all the bells and whistles.

Goals of this service stack:
* Request routing etc via servant
* Swagger (servant-swagger)
* Db connection pooling/management (persistent)
* Logging
* Configuration
